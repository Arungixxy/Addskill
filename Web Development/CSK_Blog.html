        <h5>Chepauk, Mar 22, 2021</h5>
        <p>Chennai Super Kings pulled off a stunning heist in the final of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2018 when they made a stunning comeback after a poor showing in the first five overs of the game. Shane Watson, who looked a bit out of form at the start, clicked in the later moments and scored 117* off 57 to propel CSK to their third IPL title win.</p>
        <p> win would not have been possible had Suresh Raina not shared 117-run partnership along with him. They both steered the team to a comfortable position, from where Watson did rest of the work. The win was much special as CSK franchise made its comeback to the league after a period of two years and straightaway ended up as the champions.</p>
